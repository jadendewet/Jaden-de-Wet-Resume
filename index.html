        <p class="aboutMeText">My name is Jaden de Wet. I am an aspiring software developer looking to gain practical experience in the software development industry.<br> 
            I grew up around technology and as I got older I became more and more interested in how computers work and how each component interacts with each other. <br>
            I enjoy learning about new technologies and the new functionality they could add to existing software.<br>
            I am highly motivated to expand my knowledge and abilities and hope to be a valuable member to any team</p>
